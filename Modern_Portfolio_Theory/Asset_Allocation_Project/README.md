# Multi-Asset Portfolio Allocation Strategies Analysis

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to a comprehensive analysis and enhancement of our firm's multi-asset portfolio allocation strategies, with a particular focus on the Murray Investments Balanced Fund (MIBF). Our goal is to ensure that MIBF not only meets industry standards but also stands out among peers in the MA50to60 category by delivering superior performance.

## Objective
Our task is to devise a strategy that enables MIBF to outperform at least 60% of its peers, thereby substantiating the marketing claims of exceptional performance. We will achieve this by optimizing asset allocation, enhancing security selection, and adhering to Murray Investments' market forecasts, all while maintaining a controlled tracking error relative to the established benchmark.

## Data Insights

* Annualized excess performance of 31 competing funds within the MA50to60 category.
* Monthly index returns for asset classes represented in MIBF.
* Monthly returns for the MIBF portfolio's asset classes.
* A standard benchmark comparison of 55% Global Equity and 45% US Aggregate Bond.

## Strategy Development
We are looking to strike a balance between asset allocation and security selection to maximize the fund's performance. The following considerations will be integral to our approach:

* Asset class tilts and security selection will be our primary tools for generating excess returns.
* We aim to double the current levels of active decision-making within each asset class sleeve without compromising the Information Ratio.
* Adjustments to the aggressiveness of the security selection process may be made, up to a reduction of 50%, if strategically beneficial.
* The core of our risk relative to the benchmark will stem from asset allocation decisions.
