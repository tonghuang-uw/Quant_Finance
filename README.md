# Quant Finance

This is a collection of notes exploring a number of topics and projects in Quantitative Finance (QF). The idea is to use Python to illustrate the theoretical concepts. 

## Quant Finance Projects

### 1. Modern Portfolio Theory
This project includes notes on CAPM, and a optimization project that aims to minimize the tracking error of a portfolio.

[Click here for the link](Modern_Portfolio_Theory/README.md)

### 2. Monte Carlo Methods
These are small applications that Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve.

- [Asian Options](Monte_Carlo_Methods/Applications/Asian_options.ipynb)
- [Defaultable Bond](Monte_Carlo_Methods/Applications/Defaultable_bonds.ipynb)
- [Exotic Option](Monte_Carlo_Methods/Applications/Exotic_option.ipynb)
- [Insurance Payout](Monte_Carlo_Methods/Applications/Insurance_payout.ipynb)
- [Portfolio Evaluation](Monte_Carlo_Methods/Applications/Portfolio_Evaluation.ipynb)

#### Bigger project (Monte Carlo)
Under construction

### 3. Pair Trading Research Project
This project aims to evaluate a pair trading strategy where assuming the pair time series as OU process.

More details can be found in another repo *PairTrading*

### 4. Numerical Method for pricing derivative

Under construction

### 5. Portfolio Analysis

This project is to Calculate Market and Credit Value at Risk (V aR) and Expected Short Fall (ES) of a portfolio of “Corporate” Zero Coupon Bonds with different maturities.

## Quant Finance Topics

### Monte Carlo methods
These are the notes of different stochastic process and ways to simulate them:

- [Multivariate Distribution (fit a t distribution)](Data_Analysis/Multivariate_model.ipynb)
- [Resampling](Data_Analysis/resampling.ipynb)
- [Linear Model](Data_Analysis/simple_lm.ipynb)
- [Multivariate Model](Data_Analysis/Multivariate_model.ipynb)
- [More Regression](Data_Analysis/Regression_advanced.ipynb)
- [Time Series](Data_Analysis/Time_series.ipynb)
- [Factor Model](Data_Analysis/Factors_model.ipynb)
